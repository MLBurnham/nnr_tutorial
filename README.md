# About
This code provides a brief introduction to image and audio classification with feed forward neural networks. I provide examples with both the neuralnet and Keras packages in R. 
This tutorial is meant to provide a conceptual understanding to neural networks, not an introduction to state-of-the-art classification methods. For high performance classification, I recommend using a transformer model.
